Short Insight Summary – Risk & Finance Analytics Projects
1. Project A – Financial Ratio Analysis & Default Risk (Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis)
Dataset: Company-level financial metrics
Many firms had zero R&D expenditure, indicating lack of innovation investment in some sectors.

A strong correlation observed between:
Cash Flow Rate and Cash Flow per Share
Interest-bearing Debt Interest Rate and Default Probability

Multivariate analysis indicated high default probability in companies with:
Low operating profit growth
High debt ratios
Low net profit margins

2. Project A – Default Risk Modeling
Focused on building risk profiles using financial ratios.
Features like Cash Flow to Equity, Operating Expense Rate, and Tax Rate A were key predictors.
Consistent net profit growth and positive asset growth decreased default likelihood.

3. Project B – Market Risk Analysis (Time Series)
Dataset: Stock price data (Infosys, Axis Bank, SAIL, etc.) from 2014

Analysis highlighted:
Infosys and Shree Cement had relatively higher mean prices.
SAIL and Indian Hotels showed more price stability but lower valuation.
Standard deviation indicated Sun Pharma and Mahindra & Mahindra had higher volatility.
These patterns suggest varying exposure to systematic market risk.

Formal Analytics Report: Risk & Finance Analytics Summary
Objective
To analyze financial data from companies and market price trends to evaluate default risk and market risk exposure using exploratory and statistical techniques.

Methodology
Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate Analysis to identify financial risk indicators.
Time-series descriptive statistics for equity-level market risk profiling.
Dataset sourced from company balance sheets and public market data.

Key Findings
High cash flow rate and net profit per share correlate with lower default probabilities.
Companies with high operating expense rates but flat revenue growth were flagged as higher risk.
Infosys and Shree Cement were among the most volatile and valuable stocks in the market data.
SAIL and Jet Airways showed low valuations and possible decline signals.

Recommendations
Prioritize multivariate regression or classification models to score firms on default probability.
Use portfolio optimization techniques for managing exposure to highly volatile stocks.
Encourage monitoring of operating and financial efficiency ratios (especially in debt-heavy sectors).
Implement Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis in market risk module for more accurate financial decision-making.
